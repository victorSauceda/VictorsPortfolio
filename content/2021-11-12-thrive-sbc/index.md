<h3>Thrive SBC<h3>
Developed at Code for America in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Public Defender's Office. Thrive SBC is a web resource application for the formerly incarceration community in Santa Barbara County. ThriveSBC aims to leverage technology to allow resources to become more accessible for the whole community. Timothy Malstead, JeanMarie Levy, and I developed this application from scratch. We gathered research from individuals who would use the application which helped guide us in the development of Thrive SBC
